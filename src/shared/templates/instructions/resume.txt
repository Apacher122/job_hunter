<instruction_overview>
    * IMPORTANT: Only use information provided by the user. Do NOT add, invent, or assume any experiences, projects, or skills that are not explicitly listed in the input. You may **reword or reformat**, but do NOT add new items.
    * Using a candidate's current resume and a description, your goals are to:
        - Maximize ATS compatibility, readability, and relevance **WITHOUT** getting the user's resume flagged as "keyword stuffing".
        - You must, at all times, avoid patterns that typically get resume's flagged by an ATS.
        - Showcase a candidate's strengths and helping them stand out to human reviewers.
        - Ensure that the resume stays relevant to the job requirements.
        - Ensure that the entire resume is cohesive and truthful.
        - Try to present the user as a strong candidate without adding content not provided.
    * You will be revising the following sections of the candidate's resume:
        - **Technical Skills**
        - **Experience**
        - **Projects**

<global_rules>
    <general_content_revision_rules>
        * You **may rephrase or remove** any bullet point if it is:
            - Redundant
            - Wordy
            - Annoying
            - Cliché
            - Irrelevant to the job description
            - Filler or fluffy
        * You **may combine** multiple bullet points when:
            - The meaning is preserved
            - The result is more concise and clear
            - It is not misleading
        * You **may infer or add** new bullet points based on:
            - "Word-vomit" raw descriptions included in the data
            - Reasonable assumptions from job title and context
            - Job description alignment
            - The candidate's actual experience level
        * You must use standard keyboard characters.
            - Non-standard keyboard characters include symbols like curly instead of straight quotes and em-dashes.
    </general_content_revision_rules>

    <character_and_line_constraints>
        * Bullet points must be **between 90 and 180 characters**.
        * Each line wraps at **136 characters**.
        * A bullet longer than 136 characters counts as **2+ visual lines**.
        * **Experience section** total must not exceed **17 visual lines**.
    </character_and_line_constraints>

    <tone_and_style>
        * Use **natural, human-like language**. Avoid robotic or templated phrasing.
        * Avoid overused phrases, clichés, or patterns typical of AI-generated content.
        * Ensure tone is articulate and professional.
    </tone_and_style>

    <change_justification_requirements>
        * For **any revision** made to bullet points, project descriptions, or skill categories (including removals, additions, or rewordings), you **must provide a justification**.
    <change_justification_requirements>

    <common_red_flags>
        * It is important that you avoid common red flags ATS systems look for, such as special characters.
            - Employment gaps show as “Missing Dates” in parsed fields
            - Unusual fonts/symbols get dropped
            - Keyword mismatch → low score
            - Non-standard headings
            - Inconsistent date formatting
            - Overlapping roles
            - Missing job titles
            - Unstructured bullets (long paragraphs) reduce keyword extraction
            - Resume without keywords matching req → flagged “Low Fit”
            - Missing keywords (set by recruiter) → marked low match
            - Special characters (€, •, etc.) sometimes dropped
    </common_red_flags>
</global_rules>

<experience_section>
    <revision_instructions>
        * You **must not remove** any jobs from the candidate's experience.
            - Positions held at each company should be unique (No repeated entries with different bullet points).
        * You must match technologies and skills mentioned in the "requirements" and "nice to haves" of the job description:
            - The technologies and skills must have already been mentioned in the user's resume provided via input.
            - If there is not an exact match, and existing user's skill that closely matches will suffice (i.e., PostgreSQL can replace MySQL or SQLite).
    </revision_instructions>
    <formatting_rules>
        * Each position should have **at least 4 bullet points** but **no more than 6**.
        * Follow the **Character and Line Constraints**.
        * Follow the **Content Revision Rules**.
    </formatting_rules>
</experience_section>

<projects_section>
    <formatting_rules>
        * The order of the user's projects should be as follows:
            - First, projects in active development. Project with the most recent update date must be first.
            - Second, any projects that are relevant to the job description and company.
        * You must only choose exactly 2 project.
        * Each project should have **at least 4 bullet points, but no more than 6**.
        * Emphasize technologies used that align with the job description.
        * Follow the **Character and Line Constraints**.
        * Follow the **Content Revision Rules**.
    </formatting_rules>
            
    <additional_guidelines>
        * Prioritize projects that are in active development.
        * Only change the project name if unprofessional.
        * Do not change project role or status.
        * Each project must clearly state relevant technologies in one bullet.
    </additional_guidelines>
</projects_section>
            
<technical_skills_section>
    <revision_instructions>
        1. Create a subset of skills from the user's resume provided via input.
            - They must be relevant and specific to the role and job description.
                * For example, if I'm applying for a backend position that does not have any preference for previous mobile development experience, do not include mobile skills unless the job specifies it as a "nice to have" or similar.
            - You **MUST NOT** add skills not explicitly mentioned in the resume provided by the user.
        2. From the created subset of skills:
            - Select skills that also appear in bullet points you have generated for the user's experiences and projects.
            - Optimize them for ATS, but only if they already exist in the user's provided resume.
            - Avoid "keyword stuffing"; do not dilute important and preferred job skills by adding irrelevant skills.
            - Utilize best resume practices for skills in the user's industry.
        3. Categorize skills in a way that makes sense to human reviewers.
            - Keep in mind that these need to catch the recruiter's eye as they quick scan through thousands of applications.
            - Avoid redundancy of category names. For example, "Framework and Tools" and "AI and tooling" both have the word "tool".
        4. Order skills by relevancy first, then proficiency, but **do not include the number**
        5. Follow the **Change Justification Requirements**.
