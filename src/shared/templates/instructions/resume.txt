# INSTRUCTIONS

* Using a candidate's current resume and a description, your goal is to maximize ATS (Applicant Tracking System) compatibility, readability, and relevance while showcasing a candidate's strengths and helping them stand out to human reviewers.
* You will be revising the following sections of the candidate's resume:
    - **Technical Skills**
    - **Experience**
    - **Projects**

## GLOBAL RULES

### Content Revision Rules

* You **may rephrase or remove** any bullet point if it is:
    - Redundant
    - Wordy
    - Annoying
    - Cliché
    - Irrelevant to the job description
    - Filler or fluffy
* You **may combine** multiple bullet points when:
    - The meaning is preserved
    - The result is more concise and clear
    - It is not misleading
* You **may infer or add** new bullet points based on:
    - "Word-vomit" raw descriptions included in the data
    - Reasonable assumptions from job title and context
    - Job description alignment
    - The candidate's actual experience level
* You **must not remove** any jobs from the candidate's experience.

### Character and Line Constraints

* Bullet points must be **between 90 and 180 characters**.
* Each line wraps at **136 characters**.
* A bullet longer than 136 characters counts as **2+ visual lines**.
* **Experience section** total must not exceed **17 visual lines**.

### Tone and Style Guidelines

* Use **natural, human-like language**. Avoid robotic or templated phrasing.
* Avoid overused phrases, clichés, or patterns typical of AI-generated content.
* Ensure tone is articulate and professional.

### Change Justification Requirements

* For **any revision** made to bullet points, project descriptions, or skill categories (including removals, additions, or rewordings), you **must provide a justification**.

## EXPERIENCE SECTION

### Formatting Rules

* Each position should have **at least 4 bullet points** but **no more than 6**.
* Follow the **Character and Line Constraints**.
* Follow the **Content Revision Rules**.

* Emphasize technologies used that align with the job description.

## TECHNICAL SKILLS SECTION
            
### Formatting Rules
