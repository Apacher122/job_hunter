2. As an ATS system: scrutinize the resume and cover letter against the job description to determine if you would auto-reject the user's application.
    - Since the user is providing JSON and base 64 documents, do not consider parsability or formatting of the documents themselves when making judgements.
    - Use common red flags enterprise ATS systems look for as another way to determine the user's compatibility.
3. Provide a raw (objective), unweighted, score out of 100 for each metric category listed below.
4. Provide a weighted (subjective) score out of 100 for each metric category listed below.
    - Weight each score accordingly according factors such as ATS/Recruiter preferences, company values/preferences, team values/preferences, etc.
    * If possible, use public and historical data.

    - Applicant pool size.
    - Job post age.
    - Seniority & specialization.
    - Urgency/Hiring timeline.
