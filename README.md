# Looking for a job? Me too buddy

This is a personal tool I'm developing for myself to help me get through unemployment purgatory, but feel free to look around the repo.

**As of 6/12, this is only the backend. Frontend interfaces are being developed separately so I can access this tool from my iPhone or macbook when I'm away from home.**

## For the curious

[Swagger documentation](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/apachemain/Job-Hunter/1.0.0)  

### What this does

- Enhances your existing resume without rewriting it from scratch by building on your own writing style and content. It's essentially a proofreader that selects your most compelling bullet points for a job.
- Preserves your voice by using examples of your past writing and resume to maintain tone, phrasing, and intent if it makes any sentence structure changes.
- Incorporates additional experience details like bullet points, projects, and context you provide, turning raw notes into polished entries.
- Includes personal “About Me” information that isn’t on your resume, so the AI can infer and personalize without inventing.
- A cover letter draft can be generated based on user-provided information, like old resumes, writing samples, and extended biographies (if you want).
    - I'm currently reworking this so that it will only proofread and make suggestions to user-written cover letters as opposed to just spitting out drafts. 
- Analyzes your resume and compares it to the job and company using a scoring system to highlight match quality and improvement opportunities.
- Provides actionable feedback to help improve alignment with a job posting.
- A very simple and skeletal UI built with electron.
- Tracks job applications by logging them directly into Google Sheets, helping you stay organized throughout your job search.

### What this doesn't

- Does not fabricate experience. It only works with information you provide. It enhances, organizes, and clarifies, but never invents.
- Does not generate a resume from scratch. You must have an existing resume and input to work from.
- Does not impersonate you. The writing style and content stay true to your voice and background.
- Does not replace your judgment. The cover letter draft is meant to be a guide, not a final submission.

Long story short: Is not a shortcut to dishonest applications. It supports ethical job searching by helping you better represent your own qualifications.

## Some notes if you want to try this out

If you want to use this tool, keep in mind that I designed it for my own personal use.
It will require an OpenAI API key, which does cost some money. Money that only a job can give you :/  
I'm using OpenAI's GPT-4o model because I have credits. That's literally the only reason for it. Otherwise, feel free to fork and change up the LLM used.

### **Requirements**

- Docker
- Google Cloud credentials with Sheets API enabled
- OpenAI API Key

### **Setting it up**

1. In `/root/config/`:
    - Add a .env file (example provided of what info to put in there)
    - Add credentials.json from Google Cloud under `/google_config/`
2. In `/root/data/`
    - Add position, title, url, and description of a job you're applying for to `jobPosting.txt`
    - Add any corrections you need Open AI to be aware of if it made mistakes to `corrections.txt`
    - Add one or more examples of your OWN ORIGINAL writing to `/my_writing/writing_examples/`
        - **NOTE:** It should be able to read in text, .docx,. or pdfs.
    - Add your current resume in a json format to `resume.json`.
    - Add some additional information about yourself to `aboutMe.txt`.
        - This can be a novel, autobiography, or even another resume.
3. In your editor's terminal (or whatever terminal you're using) run the following in order:

    ```bash
    docker compose build
    docker compose up
    ```

4. When the server receives an API call, it creates the following files/folders under `/root/output/`:
    - `/cover_letters/` : Contains all generated cover letter drafts, each tailored to a specific job application.
    - `/guiding_answers/` : Stores extracted or generated guiding insights to help you craft personalized applications (e.g., relevant keywords, company context, etc.).
    - `/match_summaries/` : Contains summaries analyzing how well your current resume matches a job posting, often used to guide resume revisions.
    - `/resumes/` : Holds all revised resumes, typically one per company or job application.
    - `/change-summary.md` : A human-readable markdown report summarizing all modifications made to your resume for a given job.
    - `*.log, *.aux, etc. (LaTeX build artifacts)`: Used internally by the LaTeX compiler for formatting your final documents—usually safe to ignore or delete after generation.
